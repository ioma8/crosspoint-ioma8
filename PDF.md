# PDF reading support

## Entry point

`Pdf::open(path)` (`lib/Pdf/Pdf.cpp`) opens the file via `HalStorage`, parses the cross-reference data, loads the catalog and page tree, optionally rebuilds the outline from the file (or from `PdfCache` metadata), and returns a handle used to fetch pages.

## Cross-reference (`lib/Pdf/Pdf/XrefTable.*`)

The xref tells us where each object starts in the file, or that it lives inside an **object stream**.

1. **Classic tables** — Lines starting with `xref`, subsection rows, and a `trailer` dict. Incremental PDFs chain older sections through `/Prev`; sections are merged **oldest first**, then newer updates overwrite. Empty subsections (`0 0`) are allowed.

2. **XRef streams** — When `startxref` points at an object whose dict has `/Type /XRef`, the xref is read from a **FlateDecode** stream. Rows use `/W` field widths: type **1** is a normal file offset; type **2** means the object is stored in an **object stream** (`/Type /ObjStm`) identified by another object number.

3. **Object streams** — For each referenced ObjStm object, the library decompresses the stream, parses the integer header (`/N`, `/First`), and splits embedded objects. Offsets in the header are **relative to `/First`** in the decoded stream. Parsed dicts and raw stream bytes are cached in memory maps (`inlineDict_` / `inlineStream_`).

4. **Reading objects** — `readDictForObject` resolves a dict from a file offset or from the object-stream cache. `readStreamForObject` returns dict + payload bytes for stream objects (file-backed or cached). Page tree walking and outlines use dict reads; page **content** uses stream reads.

## PDF objects (`lib/Pdf/Pdf/PdfObject.*`)

`readAt` skips the `id gen obj` header and returns the dictionary body, or locates `stream` / `endstream` for stream objects. **`/Length` may be indirect** (`n g R`); when an `XrefTable*` is passed in, the length is read from that object’s stream (not from the first integer of the reference alone).

## Page tree and navigation (`lib/Pdf/Pdf/PageTree.*`)

Starting from `/Pages` in the catalog, the code walks `/Kids` arrays, treating `/Pages` nodes as internal and `/Page` nodes as leaves. Each page stores both a **file offset** (may be zero for object-stream-only objects) and the **object id**; `Pdf::getPage` uses the object id plus `readDictForObject` / `readStreamForObject`.

## Outlines (`lib/Pdf/Pdf/PdfOutline.*`)

Optional `/Outlines` tree is walked using `readDictForObject`. Titles and destinations are interpreted enough to map many entries to a page index.

## Content streams (`lib/Pdf/Pdf/ContentStream.*`, `StreamDecoder.*`)

Page `/Contents` (and similar) stream bytes are optionally **FlateDecode**d (`StreamDecoder`, uzlib-backed `InflateReader`). Operators are scanned in a small subset: text (`Tj`, `TJ`, positioning), image `Do` with `/Resources` → `/XObject` (file-offset images only), etc. Output is a `PdfPage`: text blocks (rough reading order), image descriptors, and a simple draw order list.

**Text extraction** is intentionally limited: string literals and hex strings are mapped with a WinAnsi-style table and UTF-16 BOM handling. **CID fonts, CMaps, and glyph-index `TJ` arrays** are not fully interpreted, so some PDFs show little or no text even when the pipeline succeeds.

## Cache (`lib/Pdf/Pdf/PdfCache.*`)

Rendered `PdfPage` data and outline metadata can be stored on the device to avoid re-parsing; progress (last page) is persisted separately.

## Host tests (`test/pdf/`)

`run_pdf_parser_tests.sh` builds `test/pdf/build/pdf_parser_host_test` against the same `lib/Pdf` sources with a tiny in-memory `HalFile` stub, to validate xref, page tree, outlines, and content parsing on sample files without flashing firmware.
